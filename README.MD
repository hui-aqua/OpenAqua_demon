## File structures:

- **asterinput**
  - [**module**](/Documents/module.md)
  - asterinput1.py  --> calculation script
  - asterinput2.py --> calculation script
  - ASTERRUN.export  -->  submit job for code aster

* clean.sh --> clean the generated files

* run.sh --> start the simulation

* [setting.py](Documents/setting.md)



## Work environments

Required packages:

* [python 3.6 (or higher)](https://www.python.org/)

* [Numpy 1.20 (or higher)](https://numpy.org/)

* [Code_aster 14.6 (or higher stable version)](https://www.code-aster.org/spip.php?article272)

  Please check if `as_run` located at the following default installation path:

  > /opt/aster146/bin/as_run

  If not, you need to change Line 16  in `run.sh` and  Line 2 in `ASTERRUN.export` according to your environments.

* [salome_meca 2019.0.3](https://www.code-aster.org/spip.php?article303)

  Please check if `salome` located at the following default installation path:

  Default installation path:

  > /opt/salome_meca/appli_V2019.0.3_universal/salome
  
  If not, you need to change Line 2  in  [`run.sh`](Example/run.sh) according to your environments.
## How to start the job

*Easy and Fun*

1. Open a terminal and change the directory to the `Example`

2. Type the command:

   ``` shell
   sh run.sh
   ```

3. Wait until the job finish.



* Want to clean the generated file and run a different cases? use `sh clean.sh ` to clean these files and run again.
